This repository contains the official implementation of the paper "CleanDIFT: Diffusion Features without Noise".

We propose CleanDIFT, a novel method to extract noise-free, timestep-independent features by enabling diffusion models to work directly with clean input images. Our approach is efficient, training on a single GPU in just 30 minutes.

## ðŸš€ Usage

### Setup

Just clone the repo and install the requirements via `pip install -r requirements.txt`, then you're ready to go.

### Training

In order to train a feature extractor on your own, you can run `python train.py`. The training script expects your data to be stored in `./data` with the following format: Single level directory with images named `filename.jpg` and corresponding json files `filename.json` that contain the key `caption`.

### Feature Extraction

For feature extraction, please refer to one of the notebooks at [`notebooks`](https://github.com/CompVis/cleandift/tree/main/notebooks). We demonstrate how to extract features and use them for semantic correspondence detection and depth prediction.

Our checkpoints are fully compatible with the `diffusers` library. If you already have a pipeline using SD 1.5 or SD 2.1 from `diffusers`, you can simply replace the U-Net state dict:

```python
from diffusers import UNet2DConditionModel
from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download

unet = UNet2DConditionModel.from_pretrained("stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1", subfolder="unet")
ckpt_pth = hf_hub_download(repo_id="CompVis/cleandift", filename="cleandift_sd21_unet.safetensors")
state_dict = load_file(ckpt_pth)
unet.load_state_dict(state_dict, strict=True)
```

#### Combination with Telling Left From Right (TLFR)
Our checkpoints can also be combined with more advanced feature extraction methods than [DIFT](https://diffusionfeatures.github.io/), such as [TLFR](https://telling-left-from-right.github.io/). We provide an adapted version of their codebase that can be used to reproduce our state-of-the-art zero-shot semantic correspondence results in the [`geoaware-sc-eval`](https://github.com/CompVis/cleandift/tree/geoaware-sc-eval) branch.
